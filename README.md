# Circles-and-Squares-Game-JAVA-FX-

I created a small game in JAVA Fx to try out my new Knowledge that I learnt. It uses the composite design pattern for the shapes, and uses a Canvas and the Graphic Context provided by JavaFX to implement the program.

Goal of the Game:
with a right click, you get a circle, with a left click you get a Circle on the screen. Try to click as many circles and squares as possible before the time runs out!
